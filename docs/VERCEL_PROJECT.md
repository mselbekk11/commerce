# Vercel Practical Interview for Sales Engineer Role

## Overview

This project I am working on is for a 2nd Interview with Vercel. They assigned me a take home project which needs to be completed in 3-7 days. Once I hand it in, I have a interview on Monday next week where I will present this project. The boilerplate they recommended I use is https://github.com/vercel/commerce. I have succesfully cloned this project, hooked it up to shopify and imporved its user experience. 

## Context about my first Interview 

My first Interview was with the hiring Manager Dan Campbell. He seemed to really like me and was particularly intrested in my background in ecommerce, which is why i think they tailored my project to have me use their ecommerce template. Essentially I will be the technical resource to close business for vercel. I will be talking to companies explaining why they should switch to vercel instead of using their competitors. Please keep this in mind because when i present I will also need to talk about this part (benefits of using vercel)

## The brief assigned 


### Technical Skills Assessment: 

Please develop an application and deploy it on Vercel. This app will be used to demo your knowledge of the Vercel platform, so use as many Vercel/Next features as needed to aid your demo. Put particular focus on front-end performance, using appropriate Next.js rendering strategies, while also demonstrating your technical strengths. This should typically be a new project specifically built for this stage of the interview, but if you’ve built something suitable within the past 1-2 months, please let us know and we can consider using that as well. If you’re looking for a good starting point, feel free to use our Vercel Commerce 2.0 template.
Time Allotment: Please submit this in 3-7 days, or let us know if you need more time. Include Cassidy Nguyen (cassidy.nguyen@vercel.com), Caitlin Gilly (caitlin.gilly@vercel.com), and Jason Wiker (jason.wiker@vercel.com) if you are emailing your submission.

### Technical Deep Dive (30min):
 In this interview, you’ll have a one-on-one conversation with a team member to walk us through your project. We’re interested in how you built and deployed your application, why you chose your tech stack, how you applied Next.js rendering strategies for performance, the Vercel-specific differentiators you included, and how your experience compares to other platforms.


# Step 1: 

Please write me a detailed analysis in the doc PROJECT_DETAILS.md - how this project works. In the technical skills brief I am asked to 'use as many Vercel/Next features as needed to aid your demo. Put particular focus on front-end performance, using appropriate Next.js rendering strategies, while also demonstrating your technical strengths.' I need to know

- what rendering strategies this project is using 
- are there any im missing and you think i should include? If so what are some suggestions of things this ecommerce website can include that can use these other rendering approaches. 
- does this project use all the main Next features? If so show me which ones and what their benefits are using next features
- explain front-end performance and decisions made inside this project that support this 

I asked Chat GPT for its opinion, which you can also read in the docs here CHAT_GPT.md

# Step 2:

The last thing I need to do is to demonstrating my technical strengths. Like I menitoned, I have connected this boilerplate to shopify, updated it so it looks better but I want to include some new features. The first feature Im thinking of including is allowing the end user to upload a photo of themselves which calls an API to Googles nano bananna, and then shows them wearing the item of clothing they were viewing. Please let me know your thoughts on this, how you recommend i structure this and if you think its a good idea. Idea 2 (if i have time) is to implement the vercel AI SDK and have a button that when clicked will open a side panel where the end user can ask questions about the garment i.e. the materials they use, fitting guide, returns policy etc...Again what are your thoughts and recomendations. Lastly, are there any other quick wins or ideas you can suggest for this part that would enhance my ecommerce site and demonstrate my technical ability. Please write your answers in PROJECT_DETAILS.md

# Step 3:

Lets not do this step yet, but once I have made some progress with your incoming advice I would like to plan out my presentation on Monday next week with guidance on how to show my work and making sure to cover everything they want to see. Feel free to plan some of this out now if you like, or we can leave it until later.
