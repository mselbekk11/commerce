# Intro to Stage 2

Firstly, thank you for your help with stage 1. I succesfully passed the sales engineering presentation you helped me prepare for. Please familiarise yourself with everything you helped me with so far which is documented in the @docs/stage_one folder. The docs that are most important in that folder are:

VERCEL_PROJECT.md - this outlines the step I just passed yesterday 
PROJECT_DETAILS.md - this is what you created to teach me how the application all works together  
PRESENTATION.md - this is what I ended up presenting yesterday which got me through to next round. 

The reason they are important is because it tells you about the role im applying for and the knowledge they are looking for me to have about the vercel product.

## what is stage 2

Here is the brief the recruiter send me for the stage 2 interview:

Hi Morgan,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Jason for the technical deep dive! We would like to invite you to complete a 60min SE Panel Presentation. In this interview, you’ll run a mock customer intro call with a group of frontend engineers and product managers. You’ll combine elements of discovery with an introduction and demo of Vercel, focusing on introducing the platform, highlighting how it could address the prospect’s needs, and setting the stage for future sales conversations. The prompt has also been attached to this email. 

the attchment:

Sales Engineer - Candidate Prompt
Candidate Presentation Prompt
Select one of the following websites for your mock customer intro:
● Airbnb.com
● Jetblue.com
● Nike.com
● Upwork.com
Some suggested inclusions for your meeting:
● Spend some time upfront performing Discovery. Ask questions to dig into the customer’s
current state, their pain points, and their goals for their website & their developer
workflows.

● Once you’ve learned about their priorities, be prepared to introduce the prospect to
Vercel and clearly articulate relevant value propositions. You can focus on any
combination of Vercel offerings (e.g., hosted infrastructure, developer experience
platform, v0, Next.js). You might consider using some simple slideware and/or a
voiceover of some of Vercel's marketing pages.https://vercel.com/home

● Be prepared to run a light demo of the Vercel platform. For a website to demo with: don’t
spend too much time building a complex custom site for this, but you could consider
using an existing project of yours, spinning up a simple example website, or modify one
of our templates.https://vercel.com/templates Anything that illustrates your key points is OK, don’t worry if it isn’t
perfectly relevant to the customer’s own site.

● Consider what due diligence you can perform on this customer before the meeting. Are
there tools that can help you understand the website’s tech stack and gauge its
performance? What about their business goals?

If you’re unfamiliar with any of the Sales Engineering motions above, consider asking Vercel's
frontend-expert AI assistant, v0, for some Vercel-specific suggestions!

❗ Optional: We’re happy to offer a 15-minute prep call with your hiring manager to review the
prompt, talk through your plan, and answer any questions you may have. This is entirely
optional, but if you feel this would be helpful, please reply to this email with some times that
work for you.

## my conclusion and request for help 

so I will be presenting to Matt Jared (Sales Engineering Manager) and Miguel Caballero (Senior Sales Engineer) on Thursday at 12:30 which is just under 48 hours away. Il essentially be running a mock customer intro call, combining elements of Discovery and an introduction + demo of Vercel on a call.

I need help:

- with making an overall plan of how to drive the meeting
- choosing out of the 4 websites above (im leaning towards nike because of my ecommerce background - but i do also have a really good property rental website already built which is similar to air bnb)
- what discovery questions to ask 
- what to demo in the vercel platform 
- should i have a demo website already built to use during the demo? I feel like visual representations are always nice 
- i just need overall help telling me how to nail this interview
