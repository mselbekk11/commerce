### 2. ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK (3 minutes)

**Key Points to Cover:**

#### Next.js 15 (Canary) + React 19
- "I'm using Next.js 15 canary with React 19 to leverage cutting-edge features"
- App Router architecture (100% Server Components by default)
- TypeScript throughout for type safety

#### Shopify Integration
- GraphQL Storefront API integration
- Real-time webhook synchronization
- Type-safe data layer

#### Vercel AI SDK
- AI product assistant with streaming responses
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- Production-ready chat interface using AI Elements

**What to say:**

> "The tech stack is built entirely on Vercel's ecosystem. I'm using Next.js 15 canary with React 19 to access experimental features like Partial Prerendering. The Shopify integration uses their GraphQL Storefront API with a sophisticated caching strategy that I'll show you in a moment. For the AI features, I integrated Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI GPT-4o and used AI Elements for a professional ChatGPT-like interface."

**Screen to show:** File structure or `package.json` showing dependencies

**Files to reference:**
- [package.json](../package.json) - Dependencies
- [next.config.ts:3](../next.config.ts#L3) - PPR enabled
- [lib/shopify/index.ts](../lib/shopify/index.ts) - Shopify integration

---

### 3. NEXT.JS RENDERING STRATEGIES (5 minutes)

**This is CRITICAL - they explicitly asked for this!**

#### 3.1 Server Components (Default Pattern)

**What to say:**

> "95% of the UI uses Server Components, which means zero JavaScript shipped to the client for static content. Let me show you the homepage."

**Demo:** Navigate to homepage

> "The entire product grid, carousel, and featured items are Server Components. The HTML is fully rendered on the server with async data fetching co-located with components. This gives us excellent SEO and instant First Contentful Paint."

**Files to reference:**
- [app/page.tsx](../app/page.tsx) - Homepage Server Component
- [app/search/\[collection\]/page.tsx](../app/search/[collection]/page.tsx#L24) - Collection pages
- [components/carousel.tsx:5](../components/carousel.tsx#L5) - Server Component carousel

#### 3.2 Partial Prerendering (PPR) - **HIGHLIGHT THIS**

**What to say:**

> "This is where Vercel really shines. I enabled Partial Prerendering, which is Next.js 15's game-changing feature. Let me explain what makes this powerful."

**Screen to show:** Product page loading

> "When you load a product page, the static shell - product images, description, and layout - renders instantly from a prerendered state. Meanwhile, dynamic content like the shopping cart and user-specific data streams in progressively. This combines the speed of static generation with the flexibility of dynamic rendering in a single request."

**Code to show:**
```typescript
// next.config.ts
experimental: {
  ppr: true,  // Partial Prerendering enabled
  inlineCss: true,
  useCache: true
}
```

> "This is cutting-edge. Most e-commerce platforms can't do this - they either choose full static (stale data) or full dynamic (slow). Vercel gives us both."

**Files to reference:**
- [next.config.ts:3](../next.config.ts#L3) - PPR config
- [app/product/\[handle\]/page.tsx](../app/product/[handle]/page.tsx) - Product pages using PPR

#### 3.3 Streaming & Suspense

**What to say:**

> "I implemented Suspense boundaries for progressive content loading. Watch what happens when I load a product page."

**Demo:** Navigate to a product page

> "The product gallery and description stream in independently. Users see the page shell immediately, then content populates as it's ready. This is much better than a full-page loading spinner."

**Code to show:**
```typescript
// app/product/[handle]/page.tsx
<Suspense fallback={<div className='relative aspect-square...' />}>
  <Gallery images={product.images.slice(0, 5)} />
</Suspense>
```

**Files to reference:**
- [app/product/\[handle\]/page.tsx:88-92](../app/product/[handle]/page.tsx#L88-L92) - Gallery Suspense
- [app/product/\[handle\]/page.tsx:103](../app/product/[handle]/page.tsx#L103) - Description streaming

#### 3.4 Client Components (Strategic Use)

**What to say:**

> "I only use Client Components where interactivity is required. Out of 60+ components, only 17 use 'use client'. This minimizes JavaScript bundle size."

**Examples:**
- Cart modal (interactive UI)
- Add-to-cart button (form submission)
- AI assistant panel (chat interface)
- Variant selector (user input)

**Files to reference:**
- [components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx:1](../components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx#L1) - Client component for interactivity
- [components/ai/ai-assistant-panel.tsx](../components/ai/ai-assistant-panel.tsx) - AI chat UI

#### 3.5 Advanced Caching with `'use cache'`

**What to say:**

> "This is Next.js 15's new caching directive - incredibly powerful for e-commerce. Let me show you the Shopify data fetching layer."

**Code to show:**
```typescript
// lib/shopify/index.ts
export async function getCollection(handle: string) {
  'use cache';
  cacheTag(TAGS.collections);
  cacheLife('days');
  // ... GraphQL fetch
}
```

**What to say:**

> "Every Shopify query uses Next.js 15's new 'use cache' directive with three-tier caching:
>
> 1. **Duration-based:** `cacheLife('days')` - Products cached for 24 hours
> 2. **Tag-based:** `cacheTag()` - Bulk invalidation by category (products, collections)
> 3. **On-demand revalidation:** Shopify webhooks trigger `revalidateTag()` when products update
>
> This gives us static-like performance with always-fresh data. When a merchant updates a product in Shopify, the webhook invalidates just that product's cache - no full site rebuild needed."

**Files to reference:**
- [lib/shopify/index.ts:289-291](../lib/shopify/index.ts#L289-L291) - `'use cache'` implementation
- [app/api/revalidate/route.ts](../app/api/revalidate/route.ts) - Webhook handler

#### 3.6 On-Demand Revalidation (Webhooks)

**What to say:**

> "I implemented Shopify webhook integration for real-time cache invalidation. When a product is updated in Shopify, it sends a POST request to `/api/revalidate`, which triggers `revalidateTag()` to purge only the affected cache entries."

**Files to reference:**
- [app/api/revalidate/route.ts](../app/api/revalidate/route.ts) - Webhook endpoint

---

### 4. FRONT-END PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (4 minutes)

**They explicitly asked for performance focus!**

#### 4.1 Image Optimization

**What to say:**

> "All product images use Next.js Image component with automatic optimization. Vercel converts images to AVIF and WebP formats, generates responsive sizes, and serves from their global CDN."

**Code to show:**
```typescript
// next.config.ts
images: {
  formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  remotePatterns: [{
    protocol: 'https',
    hostname: 'cdn.shopify.com',
    pathname: '/s/files/**'
  }]
}
```

**What to say:**

> "AVIF can reduce image file sizes by 50-70% compared to JPEGs. For an e-commerce site with dozens of product photos, this dramatically improves Largest Contentful Paint."

**Files to reference:**
- [next.config.ts:7-16](../next.config.ts#L7-L16) - Image config
- [components/three/three-items.tsx:20-29](../components/three/three-items.tsx#L20-L29) - Priority loading

#### 4.2 Font Optimization

**What to say:**

> "I use `next/font` with the Geist font family, which is self-hosted and optimized. This eliminates layout shift (CLS = 0) and removes external font requests."

**Files to reference:**
- [app/layout.tsx:4](../app/layout.tsx#L4) - Font import

#### 4.3 Critical CSS Inlining

**What to say:**

> "With `inlineCss: true` in the Next.js config, critical CSS is inlined directly into the HTML. This eliminates render-blocking CSS requests and improves First Contentful Paint."

**Files to reference:**
- [next.config.ts:4](../next.config.ts#L4) - `inlineCss` config

#### 4.4 JavaScript Bundle Optimization

**What to say:**

> "By using Server Components as the default, I keep the JavaScript bundle minimal. The product listing pages ship almost zero JavaScript to the client. Only interactive components like the cart and AI assistant load client-side code."

**Performance Metrics (Estimated):**

| Metric | Score | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** | ~0.8s | PPR + Streaming + Inlined CSS |
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** | ~1.2s | Priority images + Server Components + AVIF |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)** | ~1.5s | Minimal JavaScript + Streaming |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** | 0 | `next/font` + sized images |
| **Total Blocking Time (TBT)** | <100ms | Server Components (no hydration overhead) |

**What to say:**

> "Based on the architecture, I expect sub-1-second First Contentful Paint and near-zero Cumulative Layout Shift. This is competitive with the fastest e-commerce sites in the world."

---

### 5. VERCEL-SPECIFIC FEATURES (4 minutes)

**This differentiates you from generic Next.js knowledge!**

#### 5.1 Vercel AI SDK - **MAJOR HIGHLIGHT**

**What to say:**

> "Let me show you the AI product assistant I built using Vercel AI SDK."

**Demo:** Navigate to a product page, click "Ask AI About This Product"

**What to say:**

> "This side panel is an AI chatbot that has full context about the product - title, description, price, variants, materials, everything. It's built with:
>
> - **Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook** - Manages message state and streaming
> - **AI Elements components** - Professional ChatGPT-like UI (Conversation, Message, PromptInput)
> - **Next.js Route Handler** - Streams responses from OpenAI GPT-4o
> - **Product context injection** - AI knows exactly what product the user is viewing
>
> Watch the response stream in real-time."

**Demo:** Ask a question like "What sizes are available?"

**What to say:**

> "Notice how the response appears word-by-word as it's generated. This is powered by the AI SDK's streaming support. The backend injects the product data into the system prompt, so the AI gives accurate, product-specific answers."

**Code to show (if time):**
```typescript
// app/api/product-chat/route.ts
const result = streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  system: systemPrompt, // Contains product context
  messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
});

return result.toDataStreamResponse();
```

**What to say:**

> "The AI Elements components handle auto-scrolling, prompt suggestions, and streaming status indicators. I didn't have to build any of this from scratch - Vercel provides production-ready UI components."

**Files to reference:**
- [components/ai/ai-assistant-panel.tsx](../components/ai/ai-assistant-panel.tsx) - AI chat UI
- [app/api/product-chat/route.ts](../app/api/product-chat/route.ts) - Streaming endpoint
- [docs/AI_V2.md](./AI_V2.md) - Full implementation details

#### 5.2 Deployment & Edge Network

**What to say:**

> "The app is deployed on Vercel's global edge network. Product pages are cached at the edge, so users in Tokyo and London get the same sub-second load times. When Shopify sends a webhook, only the affected cache entries are purged globally."

#### 5.3 Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) via Webhooks

**What to say:**

> "Traditional e-commerce platforms either rebuild the entire site when products change (slow) or serve stale data (bad UX). With Vercel, I get surgical cache updates via webhooks. Only the changed products revalidate, and the updates propagate globally in seconds."

---

### 6. TECHNICAL STRENGTHS DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)

**Show complex implementation details!**

#### 6.1 Type-Safe Shopify Integration

**What to say:**

> "The entire Shopify integration is type-safe. I created TypeScript interfaces for all GraphQL responses and implemented a data reshaping layer that flattens the GraphQL `edges` and `nodes` structure into clean JavaScript objects."

**Code to show:**
```typescript
// lib/shopify/types.ts
export type Product = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priceRange: {
    maxVariantPrice: Money;
  };
  variants: ProductVariant[];
  // ...
};
```

**Files to reference:**
- [lib/shopify/types.ts](../lib/shopify/types.ts) - Type definitions
- [lib/shopify/index.ts](../lib/shopify/index.ts) - Data reshaping

#### 6.2 React 19 Features

**What to say:**

> "I'm using React 19's new `useActionState` hook for progressive form enhancement. The add-to-cart form works even before JavaScript loads, then enhances with client-side state once hydrated."

**Code to show:**
```typescript
// components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx
const [message, formAction] = useActionState(addItem, null);
```

**Files to reference:**
- [components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx:64](../components/cart/add-to-cart.tsx#L64) - `useActionState` usage

#### 6.3 Advanced UI Patterns

**What to say:**

> "The AI assistant uses Headless UI Dialog for accessibility - full keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and ESC key support. The chat interface uses shadcn/ui components integrated with Vercel AI Elements for a polished, production-ready experience."

**Files to reference:**
- [components/ai/ai-assistant-panel.tsx](../components/ai/ai-assistant-panel.tsx) - Dialog implementation
- [components/ai-elements/](../components/ai-elements/) - AI Elements components

### 7. VERCEL VS COMPETITORS (3 minutes)

**Critical for Sales Engineer role!**

**What to say:**

> "Let me explain why Vercel was the right choice and how this compares to other platforms I've worked with."

#### Why Vercel Wins

**1. Integrated Ecosystem**
> "Everything works together seamlessly - Next.js, AI SDK, Edge Network, Analytics. I didn't need to stitch together 5 different services like I would with AWS (CloudFront + Lambda + S3 + API Gateway + CloudWatch). Vercel is a cohesive platform."

**2. Developer Experience**
> "Deployment is literally `git push`. No Dockerfiles, no Kubernetes manifests, no infrastructure as code. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures everything. Preview deployments for every pull request mean stakeholders can review changes before merging."

**3. Performance by Default**
> "Features like ISR, Edge Caching, and Image Optimization require zero configuration. On AWS or Netlify, you'd spend days setting up CloudFront rules and Lambda@Edge functions. Vercel makes it automatic."

**4. Cutting-Edge Features**
> "Partial Prerendering isn't available anywhere else. The `'use cache'` directive, AI SDK streaming, AI Elements - these are Vercel-exclusive innovations. Competitors are 6-12 months behind."

**5. Observability**
> "Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights give real user metrics without adding tracking scripts. On other platforms, you'd integrate Google Analytics or Sentry, adding third-party dependencies and privacy concerns."

#### Comparison Table

| Feature | Vercel | Netlify | AWS Amplify | Cloudflare Pages |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Next.js 15 Support** |  Native | � Partial | � Partial | L Limited |
| **Partial Prerendering** |  Yes | L No | L No | L No |
| **Edge Middleware** |  Full |  Full | L No |  Workers |
| **AI SDK Integration** |  Native | L No | L No | L No |
| **ISR with Webhooks** |  Yes | � Manual | � Manual | L No |
| **Image Optimization** |  Automatic |  Via plugin | � Via S3 | � Via Images |
| **Preview Deployments** |  Every PR |  Yes |  Yes |  Yes |
| **Setup Complexity** |  Zero config |  Low | L High | � Medium |

**What to say:**

> "For a client migrating from Shopify Plus or Magento to a headless architecture, Vercel removes the infrastructure complexity. They get enterprise performance without needing a DevOps team. That's the value proposition I'd sell as a Sales Engineer."

---

### 8. DEPLOYMENT & DEVOPS (2 minutes)

**What to say:**

> "Deployment was straightforward. I connected the GitHub repo to Vercel, configured environment variables for Shopify and OpenAI API keys, and it deployed automatically. Every git push triggers a new deployment with preview URLs."

**Features Used:**
- Git integration (auto-deploy on push)
- Environment variables management
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Custom domains (if you set one up)
- Automatic HTTPS

**What to say:**

> "For a production e-commerce site, I'd add:
> - Edge Config for A/B testing flags
> - Vercel KV (Redis) for session management
> - Vercel Cron for automated tasks like sitemap generation
> - Web Analytics for real user monitoring
>
> But even the basic deployment gives you global CDN, automatic SSL, and enterprise-grade infrastructure."

---

### 9. CLOSING: BUSINESS VALUE (1-2 minutes)

**What to say:**

> "Let me summarize why this architecture delivers business value:
>
> **1. Performance = Revenue**
> Every 100ms improvement in load time increases conversion by 1-2%. Sub-1-second page loads could increase revenue by 3-6% for a typical e-commerce store.
>
> **2. Developer Productivity**
> Features like PPR, AI SDK, and zero-config deployment mean developers ship faster. For a client with a 5-person engineering team, Vercel could reduce infrastructure time by 50%.
>
> **3. Lower Infrastructure Costs**
> Server Components reduce bandwidth by ~60% vs. traditional SPAs. Image optimization cuts CDN costs. Vercel's pay-as-you-grow pricing is more predictable than AWS.
>
> **4. Competitive Advantage**
> The AI assistant improves customer experience and reduces support burden. Features like this differentiate brands and increase customer satisfaction.
>
> **5. Scalability**
> This architecture handles traffic spikes automatically. Black Friday traffic? Vercel scales edge cache globally. No need to pre-provision servers like AWS.
>
> As a Sales Engineer, I'd position Vercel as the platform that removes technical barriers so teams can focus on building customer value."

## ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Technical Questions

#### Q: "How would you handle a product catalog with 100,000 SKUs?"

**A:** "Great question. The current architecture already handles this well because:

1. **On-demand rendering:** Product pages are generated on-demand, not at build time, so catalog size doesn't affect build duration
2. **Aggressive caching:** With `cacheLife('days')` and edge caching, frequently accessed products stay hot in cache
3. **Incremental indexing:** I'd add a sitemap generation API route that pages through products and submits to search engines incrementally
4. **Search optimization:** For large catalogs, I'd integrate Algolia or Vercel's upcoming search features for instant product discovery

For scale, I'd also implement:
- Database indexes on product handles
- GraphQL query batching for related products
- Vercel Edge Config for feature flags and A/B testing"

---

#### Q: "What about SEO? How do you ensure product pages are crawlable?"

**A:** "Server Components are perfect for SEO because the HTML is fully rendered server-side. Let me show you the metadata implementation."

**Code to reference:**
```typescript
// app/product/[handle]/page.tsx
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const product = await getProduct(params.handle);

  return {
    title: product.seo.title || product.title,
    description: product.seo.description || product.description,
    robots: { index: true, follow: true },
    openGraph: {
      title: product.title,
      description: product.description,
      images: product.images.map(img => ({ url: img.url })),
    },
  };
}
```

**A (continued):** "Every product page has:
- Dynamic metadata (title, description, OG images)
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for rich snippets
- Proper semantic HTML (h1, headings hierarchy)
- Fast load times (Google's Core Web Vitals)

I've also implemented the sitemap in `app/sitemap.ts` which dynamically generates product URLs for search engines."

**Files to reference:**
- [app/product/\[handle\]/page.tsx:15-50](../app/product/[handle]/page.tsx#L15-L50) - Metadata generation

---

#### Q: "How do you handle errors in the AI assistant? What if OpenAI is down?"

**A:** "I implemented error handling at multiple levels:

1. **API route level:** Try/catch blocks with 500 error responses
2. **Client level:** The `useChat` hook exposes an `error` state that displays user-friendly messages
3. **Timeout protection:** Route has `maxDuration: 30` to prevent hanging requests
4. **Graceful degradation:** If AI fails, the product page still works perfectly

For production, I'd add:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached responses for common questions
- Error tracking with Sentry or Vercel monitoring
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse"

**Files to reference:**
- [app/api/product-chat/route.ts](../app/api/product-chat/route.ts) - Error handling

---

#### Q: "Why did you choose OpenAI over other AI providers?"

**A:** "Good question. The Vercel AI SDK is provider-agnostic, so switching is trivial. I chose OpenAI GPT-4o because:

1. **Quality:** GPT-4o has excellent instruction-following for product Q&A
2. **Speed:** GPT-4o is 2x faster than GPT-4 Turbo for similar quality
3. **Cost:** Reasonable pricing at $2.50/$10 per 1M tokens

But I could easily swap to:
- **Anthropic Claude** (better for long context)
- **Google Gemini** (lower cost)
- **Llama 3 via Together AI** (open source)

The AI SDK abstracts the provider, so changing is just updating the import and model string. That's the power of Vercel's ecosystem - no vendor lock-in."

---

#### Q: "How would you optimize costs for the AI features?"

**A:** "Great sales engineering question. Here's the cost optimization strategy:

**Current costs (estimated):**
- Average conversation: 5 exchanges � 470 tokens = ~$0.009/conversation
- 1000 products � 100 conversations/month = $900/month

**Optimizations:**

1. **Use GPT-4o-mini** ($0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens) = **10x cheaper** (~$90/month)
2. **Cache common questions:** Store FAQ responses in Vercel KV with 24hr TTL
3. **Rate limiting:** Prevent abuse with Upstash Ratelimit (10 messages/minute/user)
4. **Prompt optimization:** Reduce system prompt length from 300 to 150 tokens
5. **Smart routing:** Use cheaper models for simple questions, GPT-4o for complex ones

**ROI calculation for clients:**
- Cost: $90-900/month (depending on traffic)
- Benefit: 5% reduction in support tickets (assuming 1000 tickets/month at $10 per ticket = $500/month saved)
- Additional benefit: Increased conversion from better product education

Net positive ROI even with the expensive model."

---

### Sales Engineering Questions

#### Q: "How would you explain this to a non-technical client?"

**A:** "I'd focus on business outcomes, not technical jargon:

> 'Your customers will see product pages load in under 1 second, no matter where they are in the world. When you update a product in Shopify, it appears on your website immediately - no waiting for rebuilds or cache purges.
>
> The AI assistant helps customers find the right product by answering questions 24/7, which reduces your support team's workload and increases conversion by helping buyers make confident decisions.
>
> Because we're using Vercel's platform, you don't need a DevOps team. Your developers can focus on building features that grow your business instead of managing servers and infrastructure.'

I'd show them:
- Speed comparison (Vercel vs. their current site)
- AI assistant demo (live interaction)
- Analytics dashboard (real user metrics)"

---

#### Q: "What if the client is already on Shopify Plus with their default storefront?"

**A:** "That's a common scenario. Here's how I'd position the migration:

**Pain points with Shopify Liquid themes:**
- Slow page loads (3-5 second First Contentful Paint)
- Limited customization without breaking theme updates
- Difficult to implement advanced features like AI
- Monolithic architecture (can't use best-in-class services)

**Benefits of Vercel + Headless Shopify:**
- 3-5x faster page loads (measured)
- Unlimited customization with React components
- Modern features (AI assistant, personalization, A/B testing)
- Keep Shopify admin for inventory/orders (no retraining)

**Migration path:**
1. Run Vercel storefront in parallel (preview.client-domain.com)
2. A/B test with 10% of traffic
3. Measure conversion lift (typically 10-30%)
4. Gradual cutover with rollback safety

**Case study approach:**
- Show competitor using headless (e.g., Allbirds, Glossier)
- Demonstrate 3x load speed improvement
- Calculate conversion lift = revenue impact"

---

#### Q: "How does this compare to Shopify Hydrogen (Remix)?"

**A:** "Excellent question! Shopify Hydrogen is Shopify's official headless framework built on Remix. Here's the comparison:

**Hydrogen Strengths:**
- Official Shopify integration (pre-built components)
- Oxygen hosting (Shopify's edge network)
- Tighter integration with Shopify checkout

**Vercel + Next.js Strengths:**
- **More mature ecosystem:** Next.js has been production-proven for years; Remix/Hydrogen is newer
- **Better DX:** Next.js App Router with Server Components is more intuitive than Remix loaders/actions
- **AI SDK:** Vercel AI SDK has no Hydrogen equivalent
- **Platform features:** Vercel Edge Config, KV, Cron, Analytics - richer ecosystem
- **Flexibility:** Can integrate with any backend (Shopify, Commerce.js, custom APIs)

**When to choose each:**
- **Hydrogen/Oxygen:** Client is Shopify-only and wants official support
- **Vercel/Next.js:** Client wants best-in-class DX, AI features, and multi-platform flexibility

**My pitch:**
> 'Hydrogen locks you into Shopify's ecosystem. Vercel gives you the flexibility to migrate backends in the future while keeping your frontend investment. Plus, you get access to cutting-edge features like Partial Prerendering and AI SDK that don't exist in Hydrogen yet.'"

---

#### Q: "What's the migration path from a monolith like Magento or Salesforce Commerce Cloud?"

**A:** "This is a common enterprise scenario. Here's the phased approach:

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2-4 weeks)**
- Build product listing and detail pages with Vercel + Next.js
- Integrate with existing API or headless CMS
- Deploy to preview URL for stakeholder review
- Measure performance gains

**Phase 2: Parallel Run (1-2 months)**
- Deploy to production domain (shop.client.com)
- Route 10% of traffic via edge middleware or load balancer
- A/B test conversion rates
- Collect real user metrics

**Phase 3: Gradual Cutover (3-6 months)**
- Migrate additional pages (checkout, account, search)
- Increase traffic percentage to 50%, then 100%
- Maintain rollback capability throughout

**Phase 4: Decommission Legacy (6-12 months)**
- Sunset old platform once 100% traffic migrated
- Optimize bundle size and performance
- Add advanced features (AI, personalization)

**Key selling points:**

## PRESENTATION TIPS

### Before the Interview

1. **Test your internet connection** - Ensure stable video and screen sharing
2. **Close unnecessary browser tabs** - Reduce distractions
3. **Prepare demo environment:**
   - Clear browser cache for fresh loads
   - Open all necessary tabs in order
   - Test AI assistant works (valid API key)
   - Have code editor open to key files
4. **Practice timing** - Rehearse staying within 20-25 minutes
5. **Prepare questions for them** - "What challenges do your e-commerce clients face most?" or "What features do you wish more candidates showcased?"

### During the Presentation

**Do:**
-  Speak confidently about technical decisions
-  Show enthusiasm for Vercel's platform
-  Connect technical features to business value
-  Use specific numbers (load times, cache hit rates, etc.)
-  Admit when you don't know something and explain how you'd find out
-  Ask clarifying questions if they interrupt

**Don't:**
- L Apologize for implementation choices
- L Go into excessive detail on minor features
- L Bad-mouth competitors (be objective)
- L Claim expertise you don't have
- L Forget to breathe and pause!

### Handling Technical Issues

If something breaks during the demo:
1. **Stay calm:** "Looks like we hit a network issue, let me show you the code instead."
2. **Pivot to code:** Show the implementation even if the live demo fails
3. **Explain the expected behavior:** "Normally this would stream in real-time, but I can walk you through how it works."

## KEY TALKING POINTS SUMMARY

**If you only remember 5 things, make it these:**

### 1. Partial Prerendering (PPR)
> "Next.js 15's Partial Prerendering combines static and dynamic rendering in a single request. Product pages render instantly with a static shell while dynamic content streams in. This is unique to Vercel."

### 2. Advanced Caching Strategy
> "I use Next.js 15's 'use cache' directive with three-tier caching: duration-based, tag-based invalidation, and webhook-triggered revalidation. This gives static-like performance with always-fresh data."

### 3. Vercel AI SDK Integration
> "The AI product assistant uses Vercel AI SDK with streaming responses and AI Elements components for a ChatGPT-like interface. It has full product context and answers customer questions in real-time."

### 4. Performance Metrics
> "Server Components, AVIF image optimization, and critical CSS inlining deliver sub-1-second page loads and zero layout shift. This can increase e-commerce conversion by 3-6%."

### 5. Vercel vs. Competitors
> "Vercel provides an integrated ecosystem - Next.js, AI SDK, Edge Network, Analytics - that would require stitching together 5+ services on AWS. The developer experience and time-to-market are unmatched."
